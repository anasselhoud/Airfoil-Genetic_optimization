#Airfoil Parameterizer App

In this part, we are working on automatizing the generation of NACA airfoil for global use. We linked the parameterization algorithm to a MATLAB Fig App using MATLAB GUI. Using this simple static page, you will be able to generate the control points of your NACA airfoil and plot its form using only NACA 4-digits representation.

The following picture show how the graphic calculator and generator looks like

When inserting the inputs (the 4-digits of NACA airfoil), the output are shown as below
