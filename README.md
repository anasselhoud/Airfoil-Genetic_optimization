# Airfoil-optimization
With MATLAB, trying to optimize the surface of an airfoil using Nonlinear programming and genetic algorithms. The project still on progress.

First step: Generating and parametrizing the initial airfoil, NACA 2412. The resulting points will be memorized as 4 Vectors (size of each one=1x100). These 4 vectors represent the initial global vector, where the optimization starts.
